# C-course
An example for one of the assignment I wrote during the course 

- This program replace the player who chooses the word (in this program- out of 3 options, chosen randomly).
- The user tries to guess what it is one letter at a time. The program draws a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word. 
- If a guessing player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the other player fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. 
- The number of *legal* guesses (not signs but letters, case insensitive) in the game is 10. 
Good Luck!
